# Fundamentals-of-Control-Project

Autonomously controlled an AV robot to ensure safety while avoiding obstacles on a slippery surface. Utilized LIDAR sensors, raspberry pi, and IMU sensors to program the AVâ€™s throttle and steering functions using a closed-loop system and by defining the state space representation of a lateral model.
